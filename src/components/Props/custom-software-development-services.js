          <>
            <strong>Custom software development</strong> is the process of engineering and building software solution for your specific business need.

        faqTitle: 'How much does custom software development cost?',
        faqPara: (
          <>
            Cost of building custom software development varies a lot based on number of parameters like technology, user group and complexity of problems.
            Typically it starts with just $1,000 to to $100,000 to give high level idea.
            <br /> <br />
            Honestly, this doesn't give you any ideal. Let us give you some specific example. We have recently develop invoicing software for one of our client for just $1000. It was just desktop based application and print invoice and keep record of invoice. Generate few reports like sales by month and customer. We completed this project with only one developer in 2 week.
            On other-hand, we have developed a custom  software for Petro Chemical Company which do lot of thing in diffrent departs like HR, Finance, Marketing, Sales and Purchase. We integrate our solution with SAP ERP and develop couple of mobile apps. The cost of whole solution was around 4 million dollar. We deployed around 150 expert and they worked for 4 years.
            <br /> <br />
          </>

      },
      {
        faqTitle: 'How do you choose the right tech architecture?',
        faqPara: (
          <>
            Obviously, like any other profession its matter of skill, expertise and experience. We have decades of experience in doing same thing and we are open to take expert advice as and when required. <br /> <br />
            <br /> <br />
            This is both art and science. We follow best practice like persona design, customer journey, touch points, UI Design, prototyping, and development, testing and deployment. We love agile methodology and practice it a lot.
